# 🧠 Neural Machine Translation: English to French 🇬🇧➡️🇫🇷

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** model for translating English text to French. Built using **TensorFlow**, this model leverages the **sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)** architecture enhanced with **attention mechanisms**, enabling more accurate and context-aware translations.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✔️ Preprocessing with tokenization, padding, and word indexing
- ✔️ Encoder-Decoder architecture using GRU/LSTM cells
- ✔️ Attention mechanism for improved context retention
- ✔️ Trained on English-French sentence pairs
- ✔️ Inference pipeline for real-time translation

- ## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- NLTK or custom text preprocessing
- Jupyter Notebook
